# Kei Shibayama

Mechanical engineering student.  
Studying space engineering while examining the relationship between technology and society.

I am interested not only in how technology is designed, but also  
in the assumptions behind it and how it functions within real-world contexts.

Currently aiming to pursue research in satellite control systems.

## Research Interests

- Satellite control and operations
- Space engineering and societal applications
- Decision-making processes in technological systems
- International collaboration in engineering problem-solving

---

## Background of Interest

Through participation in space-related educational programs and international engineering workshops,  
I have come to understand that technology is not shaped solely by knowledge or design skills.  
It is also formed through how people with different assumptions and values define problems  
and make decisions together.

For this reason, I am interested not only in technology itself,  
but also in the environments and processes through which technology emerges.
